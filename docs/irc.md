Nice — if your server is already **listening on 6667**, the next steps are:

### 1) Switch to a single non-blocking event loop

* Set all fds non-blocking.
* Use **one** `poll()` (or `select`/`kqueue`/`epoll`) to multiplex **listen + client sockets**. Multiple blocking reads/writes without polling will get you a zero.

**Pseudo-flow**

```txt
create(listen_fd) → bind(6667) → listen()
set_nonblocking(listen_fd)
poll([listen_fd, client_fds...])
  if (listen_fd readable): new_fd = accept(); set_nonblocking(new_fd); add to poll set
  for each client_fd with events:
    if (readable): buffer += recv(); extract full lines ending with "\r\n"; enqueue replies
    if (writable && has data): send(); if all sent, clear POLLOUT
```

### 2) Implement connection “registration” (PASS/NICK/USER)

* Your binary runs as: `./ircserv <port> <password>`; clients must supply that password to connect.
* Until a client sends valid `PASS <pwd>`, `NICK`, and `USER`, **don’t** let them join channels or msg others.
* Enforce unique `NICK`.

### 3) Frame parsing & partial packets

* IRC lines are `\r\n` terminated; accumulate bytes and only parse complete commands.
* They explicitly ask you to handle **partial data**; test with `nc -C 127.0.0.1 6667` sending `com`, then `man`, then `d\n` (Ctrl-D between chunks) to ensure reassembly works.

### 4) Core IRC features to pass evaluation

* **Auth, NICK/USER, JOIN, PRIVMSG/NOTICE** (send & receive). Messages to a channel must be **forwarded to every joined client**.
* **User roles**: regular vs **operators**.
* Channel-op commands (**you must implement**):

  * `KICK`, `INVITE`, `TOPIC`, `MODE` with flags:
    `i` (invite-only), `t` (topic settable by ops only), `k` (key/password), `o` (give/take op), `l` (user limit)【8:6–7†source】.

### 5) Protocol hygiene

* Send appropriate numeric replies/errors (e.g., on bad password, nick in use, not registered).
* Support `PING`/`PONG` to keep connections alive.
* Cleanly handle quits/timeouts; never crash even on OOM.

### 6) Testing loop

* Pick a **reference IRC client** (e.g., irssi, weechat). Your server must let it connect without errors and behave like a normal IRC server for the required features.
* You’re encouraged to write **your own test programs** too (this is one legit place you might use `connect` in a helper tool).

If you want, I can sketch a tiny C++98 skeleton showing the `poll()` loop and a line-buffer parser you can drop in.
